# sorting-complexity

## Objective: 
Empirically determine the performance of the 5 algorithms programmed in class: selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort by measuring the execution time, as well as the number of comparison operations each algorithm performs.

## Methodology: 
The mentioned algorithms were implemented in Java, and corresponding tests were conducted to ensure their functionality.

Additionally, array sizes of 50, 100, 1000, 2000, and 5000 were chosen for the experiment. To measure the operations on sorted arrays, a single measurement was taken. For random arrays, 30 different arrays were considered, and an average was calculated.
